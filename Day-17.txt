JDBC
----
JDBC ---> Java Database Connectivity.. is a specification from sun microsystems
that provides a standard abstraction(that is API or Protocol) for java application
to communicate with various databases.

>> It provides the language with java database connectivity standard. It is used to write programs required to access databases.

>> JDBC along with the database driver is capable of accessing databases and speadsheets.the enterprise data stored in a relational database(RDB)can be accessed with the help of JDBC API's

Definitions 
-----------
Jdbc is an API(Application programming interface) which is used in Java to interact with databases.

>> The classes and interfaces of JDBC allows application to send request made by the users to specified database.



Components of JDBC
---------------------
1. Jdbc API :----> WORA (Write once run everywhere)

Packages : java.sql.*;
	: Javax.sql.*;
2. Jdbc driver manager:---> It loads database-specific driver in an application to establish connection with a database. it is used to make a database. or database-specific call to the database process the user request.
3. jdbc test suite:---> for the operation such as insertion, deletion, updation these things will be performed by the JDBC driver.
4. Jdbc-odbc
---------------
>>>> sun.jdbc.odbc

>> Eclipse (Java Application ) ---> program to connect jdbc --> execute the query..!!


>>> JPA | Hibernet <----- Database !!
--------------------------------------------------------
Java Programmming connecting to database(PostGreSql)
ORM Model <== Object-relational mapping or ORM is the programming technique to map application domain
model objects to relational databases tables.
(https: webdomain)
(database : datadomain) ===> PostGreSql <=== pgadmin <=== localhost:<port> : 4digit numbers
>> Hibernate is java based ORM tool that provides framework for mapping application domain objects to the 
relational database tables and vice versa.
postgresql://localhost/Practice
 

Anything which tries to connect the server(request, response) via your laptop <---- localhost 
localhost:5432

JPA 
-----
The JPA is Java Persitence API(JPA) is the java standard for mapping java objects to a relational database
JPA is a specificaton and several implementations are avaiable, Popular implementation is HIBERNET,
EclipseLink and Apache OpenJPA.

===> JPA Specifications are defined with annotations in a javax.persistence package. 
Using JPA annotations helps us in writing implementation independent code.
 

Hibernate Components
--------------------
1. Configuration
2. Session Factory
3. Session <---- Server <--- Request and response
4. Transaction <---- Communicaton <---- between java class and database table
5. Query 
6. First Level Cache <---Java Class || 
7. Persistent objects
8. Second level Cache<--- Database 


>>>> In order to develop JPA|Hebernate project we need tools as
1. Hibernate 5+
2. IDE Eclipse
3. Maven
4. JavaSE 
5. Sql > PostGre > Mysql

Development steps
==================
1. Create a simple maven project
2. Project directory structure
3. Add Jar dependencies pom.xml
4. Creating the JPA entity class
5. Create a Hibernate configuration file
