Static class
Static block
Static methods
Static variables
-------------------------------
Static keyword can be used with the class,variable,method and block. 

Static memebers belong to class instead of a specific instance.

this means if you make a member static, you can access it without 
obeject..

OOPS concepts in JAVA
----------------------
1. What is object
2. What is Class
3. Constructors in Java
4. Object oriented Programming feature
	4.1)Abstraction
	4.2)Encapsulation
	4.3)Inheritance
	4.4)Polymorphism
5. Abstract class and methods
6. Interfaces in Java


>>> What is an object <----- An entity of the class (Element)
>>> Instance of the class
object:----> Is a bundle of data and its behavior(often known as methods)
Objects have two charecteristics
1. States 2.Behavior


example:
========> Home
class : Home
Objects_states : Address, Color, Area, Doors, Windows, Rooms[living room, Washroom, kitchen, Hall, carridor, Balcony]
Objects_Behavior: Open door, Close door

Example:
=======
Website:Class
objects : buttons,links,colors,submit_forms
behvior : request and response, server side rendering, listen at port, Search element

Assignment:===================================================
Perform the practices as on class, object and constructors   |
by taking atleast 5 of examples.			     |
at minimum 3 fields at each class 			     |
==============================================================

Assignment:========================================================
Practice all the concepts delivered today in the session          |
and make sure all the concept will applied on atleadt 3 different |
Examples							  |
===================================================================

4.1)Abstraction
----------------
Java is an object oriented language 
----> Abstraction is a peocess where you show only "relevant" data and 
"hide" unnecessary details of an object from the user.

Abstract class and abstract methods
=====================================
1. An abstract class is a class that is declared with an abstract keyword
2. An abstract method is a method that is declared without immplemention
3. An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods.
Some of them can be concrete methods.
4. A method defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass
thus making overriding compulsory or either make the subclass itself.
5. Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must als be declared with an abstract keyword
6. There can be no object of an abstract class. that is, an abstract class can not directly instantiated with the new operator.
7. An asbtract class can be have parameterized constructor and the default constructor is always present in an abstract class.

Example:
---------------------------------------------------
class : Shape (Abstract Class)
states
---------
1. area of circle
2. area of rectangle
---------------------------------------------------
---> Circle 			--->Reactangle
---->round			length
----> radius			bredth
---------------------------------------------------

====> Abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essesntial information to the user.


====> How to create abstract class
====> Keyword ==> abstract ===> make sure we will create this class above
the main class
=====> We need to create a method which can accessed with the abstract objects  -----> to making sure the abstract methods holds the data.
======> Every abstract class must have subclass of it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
abstract class <====== subclass 
---> for hiding the data 
---> Only if that data triggered then the data should be shown..!!!

1. Are we got to know how to create abstract class?
2. Are we got to know how to create abstract method?
3. Are we got to know how to create abstract subcalss?
4. Are we got to know how to create object reference to the subclass??

***** Are we got to know that why do we do all above the above?
