LinkedList
-----------
1) size of the array is fixed
2) Array elements need contiguos memory location to store their values
3) Inserting an elements in an array is performance wise expensive.
4) Same way with deleting the elements in the arrays

in order to come over of the disadvantages
Linkind list are introduced.
1) Linked link allows dynamic memory allocation
2) Don't need contiguos memory allocation
3) Insertion and deletion would be easy

HashMap
------
>> A Map based collection class that is used for storing Key & value pair.
key <--- (Integer,String)
value <--- (String,Integer)

it denoted as HashMap<key, value> or HashMap<K,V>
This class makes no guarantees as to the order of the map.
>> It is similar to unsynchronzed and permits null value.

	WEST,
	NORTH,
	SOUTH
}

Note: best practice on final and enum by taking the variable in uppercases.
